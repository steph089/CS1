Write a program in Java and run it in BlueJ according to the following specifications: • The program first asks the user for the month and year of his/her birth.
• Then the program validates the input by checking the following conditions:
 ? the input for month and year must be of integer type
? the month must be in the interval [1, 12]
? the year must be in the interval [1912, 2011]
 • If any one of these conditions is not satisfied the program must print a proper message indicating this and terminate after that.
• If the input is correct the program computes the age of the person and prints it as years and months. Then:
 ? if it is over 65 it prints "You are a senior".
? if it is under 18 it prints "You are a kid"
? otherwise (if age is equal or between 18 and 65) it prints "You are an adult".
? In addition, if the birth month is the same as the current month, then the program also prints "Happy Birthday!".
 Requirements and restrictions: • Use the scanner class for input.
• Use the Type class (Type.java) to check for the type of the input.
• Use proper names for the variables suggesting their purpose.
• Format your code accordingly using indentation and spacing.
• Use multiple line comment in the beginning of the code and write your name, e-mail address, class, and section.
• For each line of code add a short comment to explain its meaning.
 Extra credit (up to 2 points) will be given for implementing a loop for asking the user to reenter the input until it is of the correct type and in the allowed range.
