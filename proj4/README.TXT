Instructions:
 
Write a program in Java and run it in BlueJ according to the following specifications: • The program first asks the user to enter three rational numbers (fractions).
• Then the program finds the rational numbers that reperesent the maximum value and the minimum value and prints them (as rational numbers).
• Finally it also prints the average of the three rational numbers as a rational number too.
• For example, if the user enters 1/2, 2/5 and 3/8 the program must print the following:
  
Maximum: 1 / 2 
Minimum: 3 / 8 
Average: 17 / 40 Requirements and restrictions: • Use the scanner class for input.
• Use the Rational.java class from the course website to represent rational numbers and extend it with:
 ? a method to compare two rational numbers
? and a method to divide rational numbers.
 • Use the method to compare rational numbers to find the minimum and the maximum.
• Use the sum method from the Rational.java class and the method to divide rational numbers to find the average (add the numbers using the sum method and divide the sum by 3/1).
• When you write your program
 ? use proper names for the variables suggesting their purpose.
? format your code accordingly using indentation and spacing.
? use multiple line comment in the beginning of the code and write your name, e-mail address, class, and section.
? for each line of code add a short comment to explain its meaning.
 Extra credit (up to 2 points) will be given for extending the program to find the minimum, the maximum and the average of N rational numbers, where N is specified by the user (N>3).
