Write a program in Java and run it in BlueJ according to the following specifications: •The user enters two fractions each one specified as two integers: a numerator and a denominator separated by a forward slash character and spaces (e.g. 1 / 3).
•Then the program adds the fractions and prints the sum both as a fraction and as a decimal (floating point) number.
•If the fractions entered are 1/2 and 3/4 the program input and output should look exactly as the following:

Enter a fraction (a / b): 1 / 2
Enter another fraction (a / b): 3 / 4

The sum in fractions is
1/2 + 3/4 = 10/8

The sum in decimals is
0.5 + 0.75 = 1.25

 Requirements and restrictions (each of the items below will be graded): 1.Use the scanner class for input.
2.Use proper names for the variables suggesting their purpose.
3.Format your code accordingly using proper indentation and spacing.
4.Use multiple line comment in the beginning of the code and write your name, e-mail address, class, and section.
5.For each line of code add a comment to explain its meaning in the program
